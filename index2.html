            <p><h2>THE RACE BUT NOT COMPETITION</h2>

                We are in a race but not in competition – “And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.” (Hebrews 12:1)
                
                UNDERSTANDING THE RACE
                
                This race is particular, specific and peculiar to you and no one else.
                
                There are things that are trying to obstruct you in this race, they are not external forces but forces within you – they are personal weaknesses, sins and shortcomings. But you have the ability to checkmate them – “We should remove from our lives anything that would slow us down and the sin that so often makes us fall.” Hebrews 12:1 (ERV)
                
                Personally, think about it, what is that thing in your life that sets you on edge? What is that thing that makes you worried and afraid, causing you to lose your faith and confidence in God? That is the thing that is slowing you down and causing you to sin against God.
                
                There are challenges but you must endure the test of times in the cause of this race – “Take with me your share of hardship [passing through the difficulties which you are called to endure], like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier in active service gets entangled in the [ordinary business] affairs of civilian life; [he avoids them] so that he may please the one who enlisted him to serve.” 2 Timothy 2:3-5 (AMP)
                
                Conclusively, pay attention to your daily activities, so that you can checkmate anything that is causing you to be worried, doubtful, afraid and making you lose confidence and faith in God towards your race in life. You are not in a competition with anyone but running a race.
                
                “Oh, don’t worry; we wouldn’t dare say that we are as wonderful as these other men who tell you how important they are! But they are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant!” 2 Corinthians 10:12 (NLT)
                
                “We’re not, understand, putting ourselves in a league with those who boast that they’re our superiors. We wouldn’t dare do that. But in all this comparing and grading and competing, they quite miss the point.” 2 Corinthians 10:12 (MSG)
                
                “We do not have the audacity to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with some who [supply testimonials to] commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they lack wisdom and behave like fools.” 2 Corinthians 10:12 (AMP)</p>
