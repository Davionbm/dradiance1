          <h2>EXISTENCE BEFORE BIRTH</h2>
                <p>You exist before you were born
                    Birth is to play out who you are before you arrived
                    You cannot find yourself on earth
                    You can only discover yourself in God – the Source of your existence
                    The earth is your stage but your script is from heaven
                    You cannot act your role well by following earthly script
                    Your best performance is following the heavenly script
                    </p>
                
                <h2>UNDERSTANDING EXISTENCE FROM THE TABERNACLE OF MOSES</h2>

                <p>Even before the tabernacle was built, God specifically instructed Moses what kind of gifts to collect from the people:</p>
               
                <p>“The Lord said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites to bring me gifts. You will accept gifts for me from everyone who is willing to give. Here is the list of the things that you should accept from the people: gold, silver, and bronze; blue, purple, and red yarn and fine linen; goat hair, ram skins dyed red, and fine leather; acacia wood; oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and spices for the sweet-smelling incense. Also accept onyx stones and other jewels to be put on the ephod and the judgment pouch.” Exodus 25:1-7 (ERV)</p>

                <p>God knew and had the tabernacle in mind, so He instructed Moses what kind of gift that must be collected from the people to build the tabernacle. In the same way, God knows you, and has you in mind before you were born. There is a standard for your life. So, it is not everything that comes into your life that must be tolerated or accommodated. Things and people you allowed into your life must be related to the pattern of your life. The direction of your life in relation to the heavenly script that you are playing out should be the determinant factor of who and what must be tolerated and accommodated into your life.</p>
                
                <p>In instructing Moses, God specified what kind of material Moses should collect from the people and the people must be willing to give the items</p>
              
                <h2>WILLINGNESS IN FULFILMENT</h2>

                <p>Willingness is required in fulfilling your existence – “If you are willing and obedient, then you shall eat the fruits of the land.” – You cannot play out your existence if you are not willing to follow the instructions of the source - God</p>

                <h2>YOU NEED HEAVENLY INSTRUCTIONS!</h2>

                <p>The heavenly instruction is your life manuscript. How? Relating on a daily basis with God: “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” Psalm 90:12 (NIV)</p>

                <p>How do you relate with God by numbering your days?</p>

                <p>THE PLACE OF YOUR CONSCIENCE</p>
                <p>THE PLACE OF YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
                <p>THE PLACE OF YOUR DESIRE</p>

                <p>YOUR CONSCIENCE – Your relationship with God outside of your conscience is dead. Your conscience plays a significant role in relating with God and handling the issues of life daily. Conscience is a voice that no one hears but you. It gives a true evaluation than people’s evaluation of you.</p>

                <p>“But after he had taken the census, David’s conscience began to bother him, and he said to the Lord, “What I did was very wrong. Please forgive this foolish wickedness of mine.” 2 Samuel 24:10 (TLB)</p>

                <p>“…Then David crept forward and quietly slit off the bottom of Saul’s robe! But then his conscience began bothering him. “I shouldn’t have done it,” he said to his men…” 1 Samuel 24:5-6 (TLB)</p>

                <p>In certain circumstances of life, people do not or cannot really tell if your action is wrong. Your action might seem pure, good, acceptable and laudable to the people around you but it is your conscience that can really reveal, tell or inform you in a clear term that you are wrong. Though, the act might seem right but your conscience tells you clearly the state of your heart in doing what you did. </p>

                <p>Conscience does not validate appearance rather your heart – “Search me oh Lord, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me to everlasting way.”</p>

                <p>But disrespecting your conscience is dishonoring God</p>

                <p>“Cling tightly to your faith in Christ and always keep your conscience clear, doing what you know is right. For some people have disobeyed their consciences and have deliberately done what they knew was wrong. It isn’t surprising that soon they lost their faith in Christ after defying God like that.” 1 Timothy 1:19 (TLB)</p>

                <p>TO BE CONTINUED!</p>
