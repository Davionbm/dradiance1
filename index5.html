          <h2>YOUR STORY AND GOD (Part two)</h2>
          <h4>JOB A CASE STUDY</h4>
                <p>Satan is always interested in you when God is backing you with His favor and blessing</p>
            
                <p>“Job was a man who lived in Uz. He was honest inside and out, a man of his word, who was totally devoted to God and hated evil with a passion. He had seven sons and three daughters. He was also very wealthy—seven thousand head of sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred teams of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and a huge staff of servants—the most influential man in all the East.” Job 1:1-3 (MSG)</p>
                
                <p>If you are genuinely and deeply working with God, Satan’s attention is always drawn to you. He envies you but he has a limit that he cannot cross</p>

                <p>“Now there was a day when the sons of God (angels) came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan (adversary, accuser) also came among them. The LORD said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Then Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming around on the earth and from walking around on it.” The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered and reflected on My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God [with reverence] and abstains from and turns away from evil [because he honors God].” Then Satan answered the LORD, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not put a hedge [of protection] around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands [and conferred prosperity and happiness upon him], and his possessions have increased in the land. But put forth Your hand now and touch (destroy) all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.” Then the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that Job has is in your power, only do not put your hand on the man himself.” So, Satan departed from the presence of the LORD.” Job 1:6-12 (AMP)</p>
               
                <p>Job lost everything he had ever work for in his life by satanic disruption</p>

                <p>“Now there was a day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them, and the Sabeans attacked and swooped down on them and took away the animals. They also killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was still speaking, another [messenger] also came and said, “The fire of God (lightning) has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was still speaking, another [messenger] also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and have taken them away and have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was still speaking, another [messenger] also came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, and suddenly, a great wind came from across the desert, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” Then Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head [in mourning for the children], and he fell to the ground and worshiped [God].” Job 1:13-20 (AMP)</p>

                <p>How did Satan come into the affairs of Job?</p>
                
                <p>Satan has a boundary that he cannot cross but he craftily crosses it when we allow him through his instruments of operation. And what is that?</p>
              
                <p>2. FEAR – Satan penetrated the lives of Adam and Eve through desire. But in the case of Job, he penetrated through FEAR</p>
               
                <p>“I was afraid something terrible would happen, and what I feared most has happened.” Job 3:25 (ERV)</p>

                <p>Be aware that Satan does not have power and control over your life but he craftily uses devices – by stirring up a desire in you to disobey God’s instruction and by bringing thoughts and imagination of fear. But you need to cast them out when they flood your mind</p>

                <p>“(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.” 2 Cor. 10:4-6 (KJV)</p>

                <p>Resist every thought, desire, fear, and imagination that violate the plan and purpose of God for your life.</p>

                <p>“So, submit to [the authority of] God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him] and he will flee from you.” James 4:7 (AMP)</p>

                <p>TO BE CONTINUED!</p>
