          <h2>YOUR STORY AND GOD (Part one)</h2>
                <p>Everything you do in this life that has a divine backing, attracts the attention of 
                    Satan. So do not fret, or think that something is wrong when satanic opposition arises 
                    as a result of what God commissioned you to carry out – “Friends, when life gets really 
                    difficult, don’t jump to the conclusion that God isn’t on the job. Instead, be glad that 
                    you are in the very thick of what Christ experienced. This is a spiritual refining process, 
                    with glory just around the corner.” 1 Peter 4:12-13 (MSG)</p>
            
                <p>When God is in your story, you attract the attention of Satan!
                   </p>
                
                <p>Satan comes in different styles – How?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>DESIRE – Satan stirs up a desire in you in order to violate God’s specific instruction. He comes subtly to let you see the good aspect of something that has a serious negative repercussion. He makes you see the good but not the negative end result.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>ADAM and EVE – When Satan appeared on the scene, he started with a question to gain Eve’s attention. “Now the serpent was more crafty (subtle, skilled in deceit) than any living creature of the field which the Lord God had made. And the serpent (Satan) said to the woman, “Can it really be that God has said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?” Genesis 3:1 (AMP)

                </p>
                <p>As soon as Satan got Eve’s attention, he stirred up a desire in Eve to see the good side of the tree – “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was delightful to look at, and a tree to be desired in order to make one wise and insightful, she took some of its fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.” Genesis 3:6 (AMP)</p>
                <p>Always pay attention to the kind of questions popping up inside of you whenever you are on the part of God’s track. Questions that come up to create fear, doubt, anxiety, you need to nip in the bud. Questions that come up to make you feel proud, arrogant and famous in taking some steps, you need to be watchful.</p>

                <p>God’s involvement in the story of your life is not about fame but greatness in His purpose. The purpose of God is not to make you famous but to be great. And in God, greatness is not necessarily fame but having a generational impact in God’s purpose even if you are not known. So be careful of what you desire and steps you want to take in God’s program for your life; it might be good but not necessarily it is godly.</p>
                <p>TO BE CONTINUED!</p>
